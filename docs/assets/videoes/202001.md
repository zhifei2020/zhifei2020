# Getting started
Material for MkDocs is a theme for [MkDocs][1], a static site generator geared towards (technical) project documentation. If
you're familiar with Python, you can install Material for MkDocs with [`pip`][2], the Python package manager. If not, we
recommended using [`docker`][3]. In case you're running into problems, consult the [troubleshooting][4] section.
